# Game Scheduler
[Screenshot of the application](https://github.com/Hunter404/game-scheduler/blob/master/example.png)
An attempt to improve the logistics of planning when we should host our game-nights. Very hardcoded for Barotrauma but shouldn't require too much effort to be used for other games :()

## Setup
Build docker container image with
`docker build -t game-scheduler .`

## Roadmap
  - [ ] Make application configurable for other games.
    - [ ] Fetch memes from service or configurable file.
  - [ ] Add unit tests.
